## 🧑‍💻 Learning Path  

### 🔰 Beginner  
- Appium setup & configuration  
- Launching emulator & app  
- First test case

## 🔍 Appium Inspector

Appium Inspector is a powerful desktop application that helps you inspect and interact with mobile app elements. It is widely used by automation testers to:

- Identify UI elements and their attributes
- Generate XPath and other locator strategies
- Preview element hierarchy in real-time
- Validate selectors before using them in test scripts

### ✨ Why it’s important for this project?

Since this repository is focused on learning Appium from scratch, Appium Inspector plays a key role in helping beginners:
- Understand how mobile elements are structured
- Quickly build reliable locators
- Reduce trial-and-error in writing test cases

### ⚡ Installation & Setup

Download the latest release from Appium Inspector Releases
- Install it on your system (available for macOS, Windows, Linux).
  ### https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases
- Configure it with the desired capabilities of your emulator or device.
  #### refer this in case you need more assistance on appium inspector:-
  #### https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector?tab=readme-ov-file
- Start your Appium server and connect Inspector to inspect elements.
👉 Once set up, you can easily copy element locators from Appium Inspector and use them directly in the test cases available in this project.

### ⚡ Intermediate  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- Dynamic XPath & locators  
- Handling gestures, alerts, and popups  

### 🔥 Advanced  
- BDD with Cucumber  
- Parallel test execution  
- CI/CD with Jenkins & GitHub Actions  
- API + Mobile automation integration
